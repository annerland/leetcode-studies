# Leet code / Data structure studies

If there's one thing we're sure of in this world, it's that we don't know everything.

Because of this, after 7 long years of career, I decided to take a step back and study data structures.

For many years I ran from leetcodes as fast as I could ~~(except in college, there's no way to run of it)~~, but today, I'm sure that this has only benefited me, not only as a developer, but as a thinking being.

In this repository you will follow my journey through leetcode exercises, problem-solving patterns, among other stuff.
I hope you can also get some benefit from this repository.

# Patterns for problem solving

In this repository you will find exercises being solved using **Frequency Counter**, **Multiple pointers**, **Sliding Window** and **Divide and Conquer**
I Drew some solutions on my Excalidraw, I hope you can run into my logic thinking through these drawings:

### Frequency Counter
